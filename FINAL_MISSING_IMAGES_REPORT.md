## Download Scripts Created

I have created download scripts that contain wget commands to retrieve all missing images:

1. `final_download_missing.sh` - Contains wget commands for all missing images
2. `download_all_missing_images.sh` - Alternative comprehensive download script

## Next Steps

To complete your wedding gallery website:

1. **Run the download script**: Execute `./final_download_missing.sh` to download all missing images
2. **Replace local gallery HTML files**: Update your local gallery HTML files with the downloaded versions that contain the proper image references
3. **Test the galleries**: Verify that all images load properly in each gallery

## Files Downloaded for Analysis

- **Main photo gallery page**: `photo-gallery-main.html`
- **Individual gallery pages**: `*-downloaded.html` files for each wedding gallery
- **Sample images**: Several images were downloaded during analysis to verify the download process works

The gallery pages in your current static export are missing the actual image gallery content. The downloaded HTML files from the live site contain the proper `data-lazy-load-img-src` attributes pointing to hundreds of wedding photos that need to be downloaded.
